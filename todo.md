- Transition
    - Should be able to take the bubble *out* of the simulator (move to add/remove view instead of init with view)
    - Bubble should be able to animate itself to the middle and expand to fill the screen
        - Getting the video feed sublayer to scale correctly could involve *subclassing* the bubble view (?)
    - After the bubble animates we insert the full screen view controller and insert the video feed
- Transitioning back should work too:
    - Immediately remove the full scren view and transfer the video feed to the bubble
    - Bubble should be able to animate itself back to its previous anchor point and size.
    - On animation completion we throw the bubble back into the simulator.
